# Polkadot Tooling Collective (PoToC)

PoToC is a collective of developers that maintain and extend developer tooling in the Polkadot Ecosystem.  
Its structure and mission goal are stated in the [Constitution](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/constitution).

PoToC is currently in the phase where accomplished developers can apply to join through the [Members](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/members) repo.  
Hopefully, this will lead to a good initial set of members to allow healthy further growth and proper operation.
